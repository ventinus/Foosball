# Game App


### Where I want this to go:
✅ have a page to view a specific competition breakdown
✅ have a page to view player statistics
  - able to edit alias
- be able to search for players by alias on dashboard
✅ able to sort listGames by startedAt
- have an easy way to determine who won a game
  - somewhat related, have a better way of associating players to a game along with which side they are playing on (applies for singles and doubles)
- support online player registration
  - unregistered badge gets scanned, how to send that person to a registration page?
    - could have a screen display a QR code which embeds the fobId as a param, scan the code to view the form with only alias input needed
- display a QR code for the current game at the table
